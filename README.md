## Introduction
The Task Manager App is a web application that allows you to create and manage tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting tasks. The application is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, and MobX, making it fast and responsive.

## Features
* Add new tasks with a title, description
* Update the status of tasks (To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
* Edit task details such as the Title and Description
* Delete tasks from the list
* Data persistence using local storage
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices
